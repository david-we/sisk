SiSK is a split keyboard with focus on standard staggered ISO Layout. it shall be a possibility for those that do not want to jump on the ortholinear bandwagon, but still want to have the ergonomic advantages of a split keyboard. There will be a 60% version and a 65% Version of the PCB (which are already in the making). 

The plan is it starts as a base PCB which can then be easily used in your own DIY 3D-printed cases and DIY wrist rests. I am also planing to experiment with different cases like top mount, sandwich mount, tray mount,...

SiSK is meant as a wireless keyboard and my first prototype will use nice!nano v2 compatible Microcontroller boards and el cheapo 128x32 i2C displays for monitoring the battery...
