# SiSK (work in progress)
<img align="right" width="200" height="200" src="pics/SISK_logo2.png">
SiSK is a split keyboard with focus on standard staggered ISO Layout. it is an opportunity for those that do not want to jump on the ortholinear bandwagon, but still want to have the ergonomic advantages of a split keyboard. There will be a 60% version and a 65% Version of the PCB (which is already in the making). 

The plan is it starts as a base PCB which can then be easily used in your own DIY 3D-printed case designs or i.e. wrist rests. I am also planing to experiment with different cases like top mount, sandwich mount, tray mount,...

SiSK is meant as a wireless keyboard and my first prototype will use nice!nano v2 compatible Microcontroller boards and el cheapo 128x32 i2C displays for monitoring the battery...

### why?

I know there similar keyboards out there, in fact there are also kits available that are in the same category. But still i was not satisfied with the existing solutions. Some where also hard to get in europe or had no ISO Layout. Another big point for me was the learning aspect, especially KiCAD and SMD soldering.


### history

last year i made this thing, which is kind of the predecessor of SiSK. But handwired and driven by a raspberry pi pico. It worked very well but the connector between the two halves has sometimes loose contact. then i have to wobble around on the connector and it works again :P ... otherwise it worked flawless
