**THIS IS STILL WORK IN PROGRESS !**  

SiSK is a split keyboard with focus on standard staggered ISO Layout. it is an opportunity for those that do not want to jump on the ortholinear bandwagon, but still want to have the ergonomic advantages of a split keyboard. There will be a 60% version and a 65% Version of the PCB (which is already in the making). 

The plan is it starts as a base PCB which can then be easily used for DIY 3D-printed case designs. I am also planing to experiment with different case mounting techniques like top mount, sandwich mount, tray mount, gasket mount...

SiSK is meant as a wireless keyboard and my first prototype will use nice!nano v2 compatible Microcontroller boards and el cheapo 128x32 i2C displays for monitoring the battery...

## naming
**S**plit **I**SO **S**taggered **K**eyboard  
i know very ingenious :sweat_smile: but it was a very quick decision and AI created a logo that i liked, so its fine!


## features

- split
- ISO
- staggered
- wireless
- screw on wrist/palm wrest
- 128x32 OLED Display (I2C)
- 60% and 65% Version available
- first case will probably also use a foldable tenting solution (chinese mini Laptop stands)

### why?

I know there are similar keyboards out there, in fact there are also kits available that are in the same category. But still i was not satisfied with the existing solutions. Some where also hard to get in europe or had no ISO Layout. Another big point for me was the learning aspect, especially KiCAD and SMD soldering. AND i want a detachable solution for palm rests.

### history

last year i made this thing, which is kind of the predecessor of SiSK. But handwired and driven by a raspberry pi pico. It worked very well but the connector between the two halves sometimes looses contact. then i have to wobble around on the connector and it works again :P ... otherwise it worked flawless

## next steps

waiting for PCBs :) 

## ideas for future

- ANSI layout
